## Overview

SAT_score prediction project using raw neural networks constructed using Numpy and PyTorch with both regression and classification methods. This project aims to predict SAT scores based on GPA and other factors using a machine learning model built with the PyTorch framework. The model utilizes a neural network architecture to make accurate predictions and has been fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy and fast convergence.

## Features
- **PyTorch Neural Network:** Developed a robust neural network architecture using PyTorch for SAT score prediction.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Implemented comprehensive data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance and achieve high accuracy.

- **Advanced Activation Functions:** Utilized advanced activation functions, such as Leaky ReLU, to enhance model training and convergence.

- **Dropout Regularization:** Applied dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization capability of the model.

- **Reduce Learning Rate:** Implemented a learning rate scheduler to gradually reduce the learning rate during training, improving convergence and final performance.

- **Visualizations:** Created informative visualizations of training and validation metrics to analyze the model's performance.
